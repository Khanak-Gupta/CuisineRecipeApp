# CuisineRecipeApp

The Recipe Finder App is a modern and responsive web application built using React.js, designed to help users easily search for food recipes, explore detailed cooking instructions, and save their favorite dishes for later. 

### The application provides a smooth and intuitive user experience with a clean UI,
making it easy for anyone to find cooking inspiration.
Users can enter keywords in the search bar to look for recipes, 
view a list of matching results, 
and click on individual items to see detailed ingredients and preparation steps. 
The app also includes a "Favorites" section where users can bookmark recipes they love and revisit them anytime.

### To build this application, several technologies have been used: 
React.js is the core framework for building the user interface, while React Router handles page navigation across different views such as Home, Favorites, and Details. 
The Context API is used for global state management, storing data such as the search input, loading status, recipe list, and saved favorites. 
For styling, the app uses Tailwind CSS, which provides utility-first classes for designing responsive and beautiful layouts. 
The app also features a blurred background with dark mode-friendly elements, using Tailwindâ€™s opacity and backdrop filters for a glassmorphism effect.
Modern JavaScript (ES6+) is used throughout the app for handling logic and events.
